#Cheat sheet for Git bash

#Pulls from online the latest in the currently selected branch
git pull

#Tells you status of files in current directory
#RED means not added to your git add
#GREEN means not yet commited to the online repository
git status

#Switch working branch
git checkout [branch name]

#Adds files to your commit
#Probably worth googling which wildcards do what, normally you will use "."
git add [filename.extension OR .]

#Saves changes to local git repository. Treat it like the save command, for every time you hit save,
#use the command as it makes rolling back more granular
#Add a message or git shits itself
git commit -m "[message]"

#Pushes locally saved commits online to named branch (Almost always the branch you are working in)
git push origin [name of branch]

#Create a new branch
git branch [New branch name]

#Merge changes from branch A to branch B
#Current branch needs to be the branch you are merging to [branch B] in this example
#Only use this for merging the main branch into the [new feature branch] as this command skips the review stage
git merge [branch being merged from]
